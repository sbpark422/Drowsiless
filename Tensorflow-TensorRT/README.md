## About This Repo
This repository is for my YouTube video series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIGOSz2tFP8&list=PLkRkKTC6HZMwdtzv3PYJanRtR6ilSCZ4f), about optimizing deep learning model using TensorRT. We demonstrate optimizing LeNet-like model and YOLOv3 model, and get 3.7x and 1.5x faster for the former and the latter, respectively, compared to the original models. For the details and how to run the code, see the video below.
